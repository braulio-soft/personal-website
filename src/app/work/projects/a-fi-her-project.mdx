## Overview

A.fi.her, a Peruvian company specializing in industrial-grade cutting tools, is undergoing a digital transformation to optimize its administrative and client-facing processes. The project consists of two applications: an administrative platform for internal operations and a customer-focused website and app to enhance production and maintenance workflows.

## Key Features

### 1. Administrative Application  
Developed using **Next.js** and deployed on **Vercel**, this application simplifies internal management and streamlines communication between workers and the administrative team.

- **Employee Management**: Tracks worker schedules, tasks, and performance metrics.
- **Task Assignment and Monitoring**: Enables real-time updates on production and maintenance tasks.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to a **PostgreSQL** database hosted and managed via Vercel for efficient data handling.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Built with a focus on rapid deployment and scalability using modern serverless technologies.

### 2. Customer Website and App  
Currently in the planning phase, this component will allow clients to monitor and manage their orders efficiently.

- **Tech Stack**: Planned development using **PHP - Laravel**, with certain modules in **Java** for high-performance tasks.
- **Database Integration**: A hybrid approach combining **MongoDB** for unstructured data and **PostgreSQL** for relational data.
- **Front-End Development**: Interactive user interfaces built with **Vue.js** for a seamless customer experience.
- **Containerization**: The second application will utilize **Docker** for consistent and portable deployments.

### Architectural Planning  
The project employs **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **C4 modeling** to ensure clarity and consistency during development. A hybrid architecture is being considered to balance flexibility, performance, and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js & Vercel**: For building and deploying the administrative platform.
- **PHP - Laravel & Java**: For backend development of the customer-facing application.
- **AWS**: For hosting and cloud infrastructure.
- **PostgreSQL**: For managing relational data in the administrative application.
- **MongoDB**: For unstructured data in the customer-facing application.
- **Docker**: For containerized deployments in the customer-facing application.
- **Vue.js**: For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge is designing a system that can handle both real-time data for administrative tasks and optimized workflows for industrial tool manufacturing. Another is balancing the hybrid architecture to maintain both performance and scalability. The use of DDD and C4 modeling has been instrumental in addressing these challenges by providing a clear structure and roadmap for development.

## Outcome

The administrative application is nearing completion, with significant improvements in task management and operational efficiency. The customer-facing application is in active planning, poised to transform how clients interact with A.fi.her, driving growth and innovation in the Peruvian industrial tools market.
