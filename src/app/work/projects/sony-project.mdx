## Overview

Optimization of ETL processes between Snowflake and media partners, focusing on data integrity, scalability, and GDPR compliance. The goal is to streamline the data flow, replace Qlik with direct Snowflake integration, and ensure efficient handling of large datasets.

## Key Features

- **Data Comparisons and Flow Testing**: Developed robust ETL pipelines in Golang to perform accurate data comparisons and ensure smooth data flow between systems.
- **Transition to Snowflake**: Spearheaded the migration from Qlik to direct Snowflake integration, improving data processing speeds and reducing system dependencies.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensured all data transformations and storage processes adhere to GDPR regulations, maintaining data privacy and security.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced ETL processes to handle high volumes of data efficiently, minimizing latency and improving reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Golang**: For building high-performance ETL pipelines and data transformation logic.
- **Snowflake**: As the primary data warehouse for secure and scalable data storage.
- **Qlik (legacy)**: Previously used for data integration, now transitioning to Snowflake.
- **GDPR Compliance Tools**: Ensuring data privacy and adherence to regulatory standards.
- **Postman & GitHub**: For API testing and version control.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was transitioning from Qlik to Snowflake without disrupting ongoing operations. This involved carefully planning data migrations and creating comprehensive tests to validate data integrity. Another significant learning was fine-tuning Golang scripts to handle complex data transformations efficiently, ensuring compatibility with media partners' systems.

## Outcome

The optimized ETL processes have significantly improved data flow and reduced system complexity by eliminating Qlik dependencies. The transition to Snowflake has resulted in faster processing times and a more scalable architecture, enabling seamless collaboration with media partners. This project continues to lay the foundation for future data-driven initiatives at Sony.
